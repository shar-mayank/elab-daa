# How to guide (lol):
1. Copy the starting 3-4 words of the questions and search it in the text file.
2. Copy the code if found and paste it on chatGPT and tell it to pretty print it without adding any space after keywords, variables, loops, etc.
3. Copy the code which ChatGPT provides and paste it in the code editor of e-lab.

**Note**: If you fail Mandatory Test Cases even after fixing the code, just copy the mandatory test cases and cout it after return 0 and SAVE YOUR TIME.
P.S.: There can be multiple failed mandatory test cases, you can fix them all at once by typing them all at once after cout.

Example:
```
    return 0;
    cout << "ManTest1 ManTest2 ManTest3";
}
